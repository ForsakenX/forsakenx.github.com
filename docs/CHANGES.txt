= CHANGES FROM 2070 TO FEBRUARY 2011 =


* Watch player menu now uses player names and only shows valid players

* Players in watch mode can now see locations of all players

* added 15 new quake sounds

* now uses first blood quake sound; 
  first to fifty kills gets impressive; 
  killed with a gravgon gets humiliation; 
  killed with a titan gets holy shit

* killed with a direct titan gets holy shit - 
  plays for everybody (this is rare)

* included self in the list of watch players so can rejoin 
  the game from watch mode - ommitted previously

* default biker is now Lokasenna instead of Beard

* added observatory option to watch mode which will display the 
  first four active ship cameras simultaneously

* added local option in team games to view the first active team 
  mate's camera in the lower left corner. 
  On/off setting in Options -> Visuals

* fixed host dynamically setting packet rate

* fixed host dynamically setting collisions and short packets

* added in-game text scaling option (selectable via options - 
  visuals from within a started game)

* in-game menu colour now customisable (through options - visuals; 
  same place as other custom colour options). default message colours
  changed to yellow for system (i.e., joining/leaving etc.) and player 
  messages and blue for flag messages

* HUD colour now customisable (from options - visuals)

* added option to show all weapons and ammo currently possessed on the 
  middle right of the HUD (selectable from the options menu); 
  defaults to off

* added new bigger font textures and offset file; bigger font 
  textures are used only if the scaling is increased above one, 
  otherwise original textures are used

* turning off cursor while in menu

* hiding orbital circles if current in menu

* fixed the typing of text messages in the game from scrolling 
  off of the screen

* stopped 'first blood' from triggering for suicides

* mature content is now optional; defaults to 'tom cruise'; 
  from the in-game menu (detail levels) user can cycle disabled-tom   
  cruise-guts; from the out of game menu (detail levels) can toggle mature 
  content on or off (with on being tom cruise). minimum permissible mouse 
  sensitivity set to 0 (previously 1).

* default packet rate lowered from 30 to 10

* fixed requesting all players' version numbers by typing 'version'
  as a text message

* using full text names for hud 

* support for full inventory list on the right

* power pod counter has been moved to above primary/secondary on the
  bottom right so we can use the middle bottom for something else like 
  splitting chat/system messages between the top/bottom of the screen

* fixed the nitro bar to shrink if you have a gpp based on the gpp timer

* player text messages now go into their own que and are displayed at the 
  bottom of the screen; these messages will stay on the screen for 5x longer 
  than normal messages

* adjusted the team camera viewport to move out of the way of the shield/hull 
  with text scaling and set the player's name to use the small font in white 
  colour


* changed nitro/gpp bar calculation from int to float making the reduction 
  continuous rather than discrete

* fixed bounty/flag from showing up in bounty and flag chase modes - this 
  fixes bounty hunt although the bounty still wont show up for people without 
  this fix; there is still a bug which crashes when a ship collects a flag 
  which must be fixed before flag chase and ctf are useable

* fixed a bad attempt to save code causing mega crashes from revision 2130; 
  ctf and bounty etc. should all work fine now

* long message history now clears out after quitting the game, before it 
  would still show up old messages unless you completely exited the game 
  before starting another

* fixed player name flashing

* fixed hud display of power level (power level starts at 1 not 0)

* offset the upper centre message system to the right slightly to stop 
  overlap with ping

* changed default font to use the original small font for resolutions below 
  1024 width - this can still be overridden in the text scaling option if 
  desired

* now always using original texture file for trojax charge, i.e., it wont 
  scale with text (similar to cross-hair)

* missing function includes for mature content toggle

* removed bar icons from shield and hull on the hud

* player text messages spacing adjusted

* fixed (hopefully) insertion of odd characters into text messages

* tidied up the watch mode hud to work with the text scaling and the player 
  messaging at the bottom

* the current maximum score width is calculated to permit the alignment of  
  the pings in a straight column

* quake sounds now play in watch mode

* chaos shield now lets through 80% damage instead of 33%

* added special characters such as exclaimation point and question mark to 
  font textures and set the in-game font to use this - note at the moment the 
  percentage sign on line 1999 of text.c is commented out and needs to be 
  fixed before its useable

=================================================
** Changes into the new Branch
=================================================

* ported efferts now allow forsaken to run on linux natively and other platforms !

	- d3d9 is a major improvement over d3d6 in speed and rendering technology

	- opengl is a cross platform graphics layer allowing forsaken to render on various platforms.

	- openal is a 3d cross platform sound api allowing forsaken to run on various platforms and allowing true 3d stereo sound.

	- sdl is a project which abstracts the platform so a developer can build a project once and have it work everywhere !!
          support for: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, IPhone, the PSP, Syllable, Haiku/BeOS, OpenVMS, WebOS, MorphOS, AmigaOS, and AmigaOS 5. 

* sound fixes

	- removed many bugs

	- few versions away from true 3d sound!

	- stopped re-loading of all sound saving time and memory / crashes

	- only load unique sounds once and reuse them for each source that plays that sound saving memory

	- sounds are only loaded as required

* user interface

	- made the in game hud show kills as the default metric, ability to select real-score as the metric in options ui

	- various bug fixes in navigation

	- ability to use number pad, symbols (such as $), and capital letters in text entry

	- restored the biker photographs on biker selection screen

* graphics

	- ability to select massively more resolutions or to pick any resolution you want in window mode

	- speed improvements

		- all bliting has been replaced with polys making rendering faster

		- opengl and d3d9 rendering modes offer more up to date graphics abilities and effeciency

	- got rid of many down grading visual features where not needed anymore 
	  game doens't even loose a frame with them all on now !!!

		- mip mapping, bike detail, smoke detail, etc...
	
	- added visual affects

		- anisotropic texture filtering for viewing textures at a flat angle

		- support for 3d stereo rendering thanks to Lion !
	          this means you can use those colored 3d glasses to see in 3d !!!

		- increased max gamma to 300

	- fixed the scan lines that would move over players in bike selection screen

	- added a more robust wireframe mode

	- level of detail fixes

		- degrades much farther away beyond point of perception

		- enabled level of detail scaling in rear view camera !!!

	- real time lights
	
		- documented the file format

		- created a binary to text parser

	- removed old ugly fonts that were for resolutions bellow 640x480

	- texturing

		- centralized as many texture files as possibly to data/textures,
		  this allows textures to be reused by many levels saving space,
		  and allowing for new levels to reuse the old textures!!!
		  a level can override any texture name by adding it's own texture folder...

		- default mode is now 32 bit textures because it's just as fast at 16 bit now

		- dynamic textures are only loaded when required saving load time and memory

		- all textures have been converted to png to save space and have richer color spectrum

		- fixed an enemy texture so it looks like it was always meant to look like :]

  NOTES

	I get 1ms using icmp pings on my lan and 32ms ping in game with 45fps.
	There is lots of other things happening in a game that make in game ping higher.
	Use icmp ping to get the internet delay between you and a remote party.
	Then minus that from the in game ping to get the game overhead.

	Because of this at start of game ping is always higher.
	Players are still loading the level while pings start to get sent...

* fixed demo playback - watch mode was previously stealing the camera view
* removed bomb tag game (wasn't complete) and all related checks
* removed a lot of unnecessary network messages that were not being used
* fixed a bug possibly causing the host not to send important information (e.g. collision perspective and kill limit - this completes the bug fix from earlier)

==============================

==============================

* added version query ability. Type a normal text message consisting of just 'version' and all players should automatically respond with their version numbers.
* watch mode now displays the name of the player whom you are watching.

A message is broadcast to all players informing then when you enter and exit this mode. Upon entering the mode, any weapons you have are scattered and you 'die' but no points are added/subtracted.
* 'leave blank to scan for lan games' message when joining a multiplayer game is no longer selectable since it is not a button.

==============================
** Changes Since 1.02.358 **
==============================

To set the key, go to in-game biker setup and bike controls, it's at the bottom of the first page, underneath roll mode. (Note: other player's will also need to be using version 1.01.358 or later.)
* registry mechanism simplified - no longer need to run ProjectX.exe with the full path in Wine.

==============================
** Changes Since 1.01.347 **
==============================

* compiled with optimisations on (OPT_ON,USEINLINE,FINAL_RELEASE) - this should improve performance.
* added Show Statistics key to config and to the in-game biker controls (next to Show Messages key previously added). It will show detailed kill stats while the key is held down. This is still a major work in progress - do not trust the stats to be accurate yet (at best it will only show you stats from since you have joined the game - it does not get an update from the host when you join)

==============================
** Changes Since 1.01.341 **
==============================

* added ability to display the last 50 messages (or whatever fits on the screen) by holding down a key during the game. To set the key go to Setup Biker->Bike Controls->Configure Controls and hit scroll down until you come to the last page and at the bottom is "Show Messages".

==============================
