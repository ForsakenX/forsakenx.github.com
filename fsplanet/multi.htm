<p align="justify">In this game mode up to 16 human players can fight against each other 

with the unpatched version and 32 with the patched version. You may play it with your friends 

over a LAN (<B>L</B>ocal <B>A</B>rea <B>N</B>etwork) or online against freaks from all over the world.

As humans act much more uniquely and intelligently, multiplayer mode is more 

challenging than single player. Human opponents will try to set up traps for you 

and they will show different tactics and patterns to avoid your shots.

The fun factor in multiplayer-mode will be simply amazing as soon as you have experienced your first successful actions.</p>

<P align="justify">



there are 6 different types which you can select:

<P align="justify">



- Free For All (FFA) <BR>

- Team Game <BR>

- Capture The Flag (CTF) <BR>

- Flag Chase<BR>

- Bounty Hunt <BR>

- Team Bounty Hunt 

<P align="justify">



You can assign a score or time limit for each of these types.

<P align="justify">



<U>Free For All (deathmatch) </U>

<P align="justify">

The most common mode. Every player works on his own and tries to "kill" as many other players, as possible, and -oh yes- should also keep an eye on his own sanity...<BR>

<P align="justify">



<U>Team Game (ffa in teams/normal mode)</U>

<P align="justify">

You want to rock the world with your team mate(s)? No problem! Up to 4 teams compete in a regular team game in order to get the most (combined) kills.

<P>



<U>Capture the Flag </U>

<P align="justify">

In this game type each team tries to pick up and carry the flag(s) of the opposing team(s) to their 

home goal. Once a player has captured and returned a flag to his team's goal, he 

is rewarded with a default of five points. The goals as well as the flags are 

represented by the colour of each team (red/green/blue/yellow). After scoring 

with the opposition's flag, it will return to their goal. The key is that each team must have it's own flag in the goal before 

they can score. This rule however can be altered (select <B>more options  /  own flag rule</B> from the menu):



<P align="justify">

In <EM>normal mode</EM> (default), your own flag is instantly returned to your goal, once you touched it. You can only score (carry the flag of another team to your goal) while your own flag is in your goal zone (returned).

<P align="justify">

<EM>Carry it back:</EM> Your own flag is not returned to your goal once you touched it. You have to carry the flag back as  any flag of an opposing team.

<P align="justify">

<EM>Can't pick up:</EM> You cannot pick up your flag, and therefore don't need to have it in your goal to score. This is like the default <A HREF="http://www.descent3.com" TARGET="_BLANK">descent</A> CTF-mode.

<P align="justify">

<EM>Can pick up:</EM> You don't need your own flag in the goal to score, but you can carry the flag back to your goal, which makes it harder for opponents to grab it.

<P align="justify">

<EM>1 touch returns:</EM> Touching your own flag returns it to the goal (like in normal mode), but you don't need it to score.

<P align="justify">



<U>Flag Chase</U>

<P align="justify">

With <EM>only one flag</EM> on a level, each team is out to carry it back to their goal-zone. This is the 

only flag game which you can play on the <A HREF="http://www.zone.com">zone</A> 

and is incorrectly labelled as capture the flag.



<P align="justify">

<U>Bounty Hunt</U>

<P align="justify">

The objective is to pick up a gold bar (the bounty). When you pick it up, a message is displayed alerting all other players that you now have the gold bar. The player being in possession of the bounty scores points for every 10 seconds of survival (or not being scattered) if Bounty Bonus is set to ON. Of course all other players will try to take hold of the bounty themselves, and your personal apocalypse might come true with everybody in the level chasing you...



<P align="justify">

<U>Team Bounty Hunt</U>

<P align="justify">

Like normal bounty hunt, but in teams. A team is rewarded as long as one player who belongs to that team can keep the bounty.

<P align="justify">

<b>Notes about team games:</b><ul>

	<li>

	<P align="justify">You do not score negative points for killing your own 

	team mates. </li>

	<li>

	<P align="justify">In Team Bounty Hunt, only the player on the team with the 

	bounty can score points for killing other players and the opposition will 

	only score points for killing the player with the bounty. </li>

	<li>

	<P align="justify">To whisper message (viewable only by members of your 

	team) hold down the control button when you press enter to type a messsage.</li>

For unlimited fun in multiplayer some settings can be altered:<P align="justify">





<P align="justify">

<B>Start Game:</B>

Guess what that does..



<P align="justify">

<B>Level: </B>

Select the level you want to play. See the <a href="files.htm">download-section</a> for the new levels.

<P align="justify">



<B>Player Limit: </B>

Maximum number of players that can join a game (including the host). 

<font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: for Internet-play: 2 - 5 players</font>.

<P align="justify">



<B>Score Limit: </B>

The maximum number of points/kills, a player or team can amass. Once the score 

is reached by one player or team, the level is ended and a statistic shown, 

before proceeding to the next level in the host's <i>battle.dat (see

<a href="help.htm#levels">levels</a>)</i>.

Note: the score of each player is reset to zero each time the score limit is 

reached and a new level started.<P align="justify">



<B>Time Limit: (none - 30 min.)</B>

Define a time limit for each level. When the time is over (countdown is at zero) a statistic is shown before entering the next level.

<P align="justify">



<B><I>Game Type: </I></B>

See the above paragraph <I><A HREF="#types">"different game types in multiplayer"</A></I> for detailed information.

<P align="justify">



<B><U>More Options: </U></B>Select this to customise the multiplayer session for your needs. This will take you to a new screen with the following options:





<P align="justify">

<P align="justify">



<P align="justify">

<B>Lag Tolerance ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: OFF</font><P align="justify">

Determines whether LAG should be considered or not. LAG is a phenomenon which often appears in online-matches: It is a result of bad or slow connections between players, caused by geographical distance and / or by insufficient WAN-capacity like slow modems or overloaded web-nodes.

This often results in severe problems during the game: The enemy-bikes are more or less only appearing from time to time, or you can track their constant movement, but even though you see your bullets hit the other player he just doesn't die.

If Lag-Tolerance is set to ON, time differences are ignored: If you see your bullets hit another player he is hit regardless 

of his real position. So, if there is much lag in a game you might be killed without seeing any player in range 

(a.k.a. ghost hits/kills). On the other side, you should have no problems killing other people... it's a compromise.. 

however, <b>the most widely accepted setting is Lag Tolerance OFF</b>, this is 

because it is deemed fairer to give the 'benefit of the doubt' to the target 

rather than the attacker and gives all parties a fair chance of avoiding enemy 

fire regardless of LAG.<P align="justify">



<B>Short Packets ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

Short packets minimise network bandwidth by reducing the actual byte size of the 

packets being sent, but lose a small degree of accuracy.<P align="justify">



<B>Packet Grouping ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

This reduces the (huge) packet header overhead on TCP games by combining packets 

before sending. It may only be set by the host, and via the out-of-game host game 

setup menu. This option should be toggled ON by the host on all Internet 

multiplayer games, and off on LAN-based games. Toggling this option off for 

Internet play may degrade performance.<P align="justify">

The PPS (see Packet Rate below) value <i>without </i>packet grouping on is the 

number of normal update packets per second. Specialist packets (i.e. firing, 

you've been hit etc) will cause more packets to be sent (potentially a lot 

more!). For TCP packets, each packet has a 40 byte header when you consider each 

protocol layer. So having group packets switched off will cause the bandwidth to 

rise sharply. <br>

The PPS value <i>with</i> packet grouping is the number of actual packets sent. 

Specialist packets are grouped and sent along with the normal update packets. <P align="justify">



<B>Packet Rate: (1-30):</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: 5+ for Internet 

Play, 15+ for LAN</font><P align="justify">

The packet rate defines how many data-packets per second (pps) are exchanged between 

each player in a game. For example, with the Packet Rate set to 5: you send 1 

packet, 5 times a second to every player in the game. The higher the packet rate, the more fluid the other player's movement will be tracked. As lag-problems should not occur in local network, recommended settings for LAN-sessions are  

15+ pps.

On the other hand, it is a good idea to set packets to a lower rate when playing online otherwise the game will run slowly and/or jerky because the packets cannot be transferred fast enough through the net 

causing ping spikes and packet loss. Recommended figures for online-matchmaking range 

dramatically from 5-30 pps depending on the connection speeds of the players. 

Basically, the more players and the slower the connections involved the lower 

the packet rate should be. <b>5 packets per second is the best value to use when 

in doubt</b><i>. </i>Moreover, the host can alter the packet rate from within the game 

and he/she should monitor the pings and then increase/reduce the packet rate 

appropriately. Additionally, when recording games (demo-ing) the higher the 

packet rate is, the smoother the recording will appear when played back.<BR>

&nbsp;<P align="justify">



<B>Show Ping ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended:<b> </b>ON</font><P align="justify">

When set to ON, the host can see the pings of the other players (which aids in 

changing the packet rate during a game to ensure the smoothest game possible by 

decreasing the packet rate when pings are too high). This setting can be 

switched on or off during the game by pressing escape and changing the 

appropriate setting, this can be done by players who are not the host as well.

<P align="justify">



<B>Ping Interval: (1-30)</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: 30</font><P align="justify">

Defines the time in seconds to pass by until ping information is updated (by pinging the other players). 

This should be set to 30 as there really is no need to have it updated more 

frequently and adds to the network traffic involved.



<P align="justify">

<B>Bike Exhausts ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

Heh. Shall I explain that one??

<P align="justify">



<B>Bright Bikes ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

Makes it easier to see other bikes from the distance.

<P align="justify">



<B>Harm Team mates ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

You hate being killed by your team mate (he just cannot aim precisely?!)? Then you should turn "Harm Team mates" OFF and it won't happen again *G*.

<P align="justify">



<B>Flag Capture Score: (1-10)</B>&nbsp; <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: 5</font><P align="justify">

Determines how many points each team receives when scoring with the flag. (see also: <A HREF="#types">"different game types in multiplayer"</A>, above) 

Therefore, the higher you set this, the more emphasis on capturing the flag and 

the less on killing others.<P align="justify">



<A NAME="rec_dmo">

<B>Record Demo ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: ON</font><P align="justify">

When set to ON, the whole multiplayer-game will be tracked, until the host ends 

the level or leaves the game. You may also define a timer to prevent demos from 

getting too big, however this isn't an issue with today's computers.

You can watch the Demos by selecting "Play Demo" from the "Load Game" menu. Additionally, you can adjust the playback speed and select which player you want to follow (1-15, player no. 16 refers to a free roaming camera which you can control). Once a demo has been recorded, it will be saved 

as a *.dmo - file in the demos-directory of your Forsaken directory. That way you can exchange cool demos with your friends. See also our 

<a href="files.htm">download-page</a> for some demos.<P align="justify">

<i>Note: The demo will only show the game from the point of view of the host and 

so you will notice slight differences (due to lag) from that and another 

player's perspective. In addition, demos have been known to screw up and loose 

track of the pick-ups during the later stages of a game.</i><BR>

</FONT>

<P align="justify">



<B>Change Allowed Pick-Ups</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: Transpulse 

OFF; Pine Mines OFF; Chaos Shield OFF; Stealth Mantle OFF</font><P align="justify">

This option takes you to a new screen where you can define which weapons (primary and secondary weapons, as well as mines and special features like  shields), will appear 

during the game.

<P align="justify">



<B>Randomize Pickups ON/OFF:</B> <font color="#FFFF00">Recommended: OFF</font><P align="justify">

Allows you to have the same pickups always appear in the same spot right after 

the host starts the game (OFF), or to have them appear randomly (ON).

Basically you can think of gaming-ladders as leagues, represented by player-listings. The closer a player is listed to the top the better his rank is.

Once you signed up, you can climb up towards the top by beating other players, preferably those with higher ranks. Every ladder comes along with its own rules that determine how you can advance to a higher rank. The basic idea behind this is, to find the best players at a game.

So if you are on a ladder you need to find others that are on it too. After each ladder-match, the loser has to report the loss, so that the winner can be rewarded (moving up the ladder), depending on the opponent's rank.<BR>
